- ğŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @DDDaina
- ğŸ‘€ I participated in a Lyft internship on the Forage platform.
- The project involved determining car servicing based on engine and battery conditions.
- During this project, I learned the key roles and responsibilities of a back-End engineer at Lyft and gained experience in coding.
